Using networking-opencontrail in a project
==========================================

To use networking-opencontrail in a project::

    import networking_opencontrail

Using networking-opencontrail as a OpenStack ML2 driver
=======================================================

1. Adjust ``/etc/neutron/plugins/ml2/ml2_conf_opencontrail.ini`` to meet
   your needs.
2. Edit ``/etc/neutron/plugins/ml2/ml2_conf.ini`` file and put
   ``opencontrail`` to ``mechanism_drivers`` list in ``ml2`` section, so it
   looks similarly to this::

    [ml2]
    mechanism_drivers = opencontrail

3. Run again Neutron service. Make sure you include all config files: ::

    /usr/local/bin/neutron-server --config-file /etc/neutron/neutron.conf \
    --config-file /etc/neutron/plugins/ml2/ml2_conf.ini \
    --config-file /etc/neutron/plugins/ml2/ml2_conf_opencontrail.ini
