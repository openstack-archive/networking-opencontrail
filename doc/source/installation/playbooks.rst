=====================
Setup development VMs
=====================

Playbooks are designed to setup two nodes. The first node
contains Openstack with, keystone, neutron, horizon, etc.
It has also neutron-opencontrail plugin as neutron ML2 L3 driver.
Second node contains nightly-build contrail node with simple devstack as compute node.

Playbooks deploy Openstack in stable/ocata version and OpenContrail in one of the latest nightly build.

Step by step instruction is presented below.


*************
Initial steps
*************

Before you run playbooks perform the following steps:

**1. Prepare machines for Contrail and OpenStack nodes.**

Let's assume there are two hosts:

+-----------+--------------+--------------------------+------------+-------------+----------------------------------------+
| Node      | OS           | Recommended requirements | Public IP  | Internal IP | Notes                                  |
+===========+==============+==========================+============+=============+========================================+
| openstack | Ubuntu 16.04 | RAM: 8 GB                | 10.100.0.3 | 192.168.0.3 | devstack (controller node)             |
+-----------+--------------+--------------------------+------------+-------------+----------------------------------------+
| contrail  | CentOS 7.4   | RAM: 16 GB               | 10.100.0.2 | 192.168.0.2 | opencontrail + devstack (compute node) |
+-----------+--------------+--------------------------+------------+-------------+----------------------------------------+

**2. Make sure you have key-based SSH access to prepared nodes**

.. code-block:: console

    $ ssh 10.100.0.2
    $ ssh 10.100.0.3

**3. Install Ansible on your host**

It is required to install Ansible in version 2.5 or higher.

.. code-block:: console

    $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ansible/ansible
    $ sudo apt update
    $ sudo apt install python-netaddr ansible


*******************
Configure playbooks
*******************

Configuration require editing few files before running any playbook.

**1. Define nodes by specifying SSH names or IP of machines in ``playbooks/hosts``**

Change ``contrail-node`` and ``openstack-node`` to public IP of your machines.

.. code-block:: text

    controller ansible_host=10.100.0.3 ansible_user=ubuntu

    [compute]
    10.100.0.2 ansible_user=centos


Optionally, you can add a username to this config, if you ssh to machine with username: ``10.100.0.2 ansible_user=centos``

**2. Change deployment variables in ``playbooks/group_vars/all.yml``**

``contrail_ip`` and ``openstack_ip`` should be internal IP addresses.
``contrail_gateway`` should be gateway address of the contrail_ip.
``contrail_interface`` should be interface name that has bound contrail ip.

``openstack_branch`` should be set to ``stable/ocata``
``install_networking_bgpvpn_plugin`` is a boolean value. If set true, it will install the neutron_bgpvpn plugin.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # IP address for OpenConrail.
    contrail_ip: 192.168.0.2

    # Gateway address for OpenConrail.
    contrail_gateway: 192.168.0.1

    # Interface name for OpenConrail.
    contrail_interface: eth0


    # IP address for Openstack VM.
    openstack_ip: 192.168.0.3

    # Openstack branch used on VMs.
    openstack_branch: stable/ocata

    # If true, then install networking_bgpvpn plugin with contrail driver
    install_networking_bgpvpn_plugin: false

**********
Deployment
**********

Run playbooks
=============

.. note:: Before openstack deployment make sure playbooks are configured.

Execute ``playbooks/main.yml`` file.
Make sure you are in playbooks directory before executing the playbooks.
This will make Ansible to use local ``hosts`` file instead of system broad defined hosts.

.. code-block:: console

    $ cd playbooks
    $ ./main.yml

This playbooks can last 1 hour or more.

Please be patient while executing roles with ``stack.sh``. Real time logs from these operations can be viewed on each host by following command:
``less -R /opt/stack/logs/stack.sh.log``

*****
Usage
*****

Access web interface
====================

* http://10.100.0.3/ - devstack's horizon. Credentials: admin/admin

* https://10.100.0.2:8143/ - OpenContrail UI. Credentials: admin/admin (domain can be empty or "default")

Create example VM
=================

After successful deployment, it could be possible to create sample Virtual Machine.
It is important to create new security group, because the default is not synchronized correctly between contrail and devstack.

These commands should be ran on one of the nodes (both are connected to one neutron).
Assuming that contrail node has ``contrail-node.novalocal`` hostname (used in availability zone):

.. code-block:: console

    source ~/devstack/openrc admin demo
    openstack network create --provider-network-type vlan --provider-segment 3 --provider-physical-network vhost net
    openstack subnet create --network net --subnet-range 192.168.1.0/24 --dhcp subnet
    openstack security group create secgroup
    openstack security group rule create --ingress --protocol icmp secgroup
    openstack security group rule create --ingress --protocol tcp secgroup
    openstack server create  --flavor cirros256 --image cirros-0.3.4-x86_64-uec --nic net-id=net --security-group secgroup \
      --availability-zone nova:contrail-node.novalocal instance

Created VM could be accessed by VNC (through horizon):

1. Go to horizon's list of VMs http://10.100.0.3/dashboard/project/instances/

2. Enter into the VM's console.

  - If the console does not response, click the link "Click here to show only console".
  - If you see black console, press enter to attach.

3. Login into. Default login/password is ``cirros/cubswin:)``
